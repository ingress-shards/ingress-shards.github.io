These heads precisely reflect the demographic makeup of Mecklenburg County, and are individually controlled by 1600 discrete motors.\n\nAt the start of a workweek the heads are gathered into a porous cloud. Gradually, gracefully, they move one by one to create an epic three-dimensional face. This likeness then slowly reverts back into a cloud.\n\nThe following week a different portrait builds and dissolves. In a cycle of assembly and dispersion, new faces are continually formed over time.\n\nFor example, one sequence portrays an elderly Latina. Reaching an optical crescendo on Wednesday afternoon, her face gradually disappears by Friday evening.\n\nSubsequent weeks witness the formation of a 25-year-old African-American man, an Asian boy, a middle-aged Caucasian woman, and so on. Persistence of Vision is not “of” anyone in particular; it is “of everyone”.\n\nAn allegory for the justice system on both the macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, the sculpture reflects the organic process of the law and the society it serves.\"",

                "description": "By Ralph Helmick.\n\n\"Persistence of Vision is at once an artwork, an event, and a reflection of community.\n\nThe building blocks of the piece are small pewter portraits of Charlotte citizens. These heads precisely reflect the demographic makeup of Mecklenburg County, and are individually controlled by 1600 discrete motors.\n\nAt the start of a workweek the heads are gathered into a porous cloud. Gradually, gracefully, they move one by one to create an epic three-dimensional face. This likeness then slowly reverts back into a cloud.\n\nThe following week a different portrait builds and dissolves. In a cycle of assembly and dispersion, new faces are continually formed over time.\n\nFor example, one sequence portrays an elderly Latina. Reaching an optical crescendo on Wednesday afternoon, her face gradually disappears by Friday evening.\n\nSubsequent weeks witness the formation of a 25-year-old African-American man, an Asian boy, a middle-aged Caucasian woman, and so on. Persistence of Vision is not “of” anyone in particular; it is “of everyone”.\n\nAn allegory for the justice system on both the macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, the sculpture reflects the organic process of the law and the society it serves.\"",

These heads precisely reflect the demographic makeup of Mecklenburg County, and are individually controlled by 1600 discrete motors.\n\nAt the start of a workweek the heads are gathered into a porous cloud. Gradually, gracefully, they move one by one to create an epic three-dimensional face. This likeness then slowly reverts back into a cloud.\n\nThe following week a different portrait builds and dissolves. In a cycle of assembly and dispersion, new faces are continually formed over time.\n\nFor example, one sequence portrays an elderly Latina. Reaching an optical crescendo on Wednesday afternoon, her face gradually disappears by Friday evening.\n\nSubsequent weeks witness the formation of a 25-year-old African-American man, an Asian boy, a middle-aged Caucasian woman, and so on. Persistence of Vision is not “of” anyone in particular; it is “of everyone”.\n\nAn allegory for the justice system on both the macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, the sculpture reflects the organic process of the law and the society it serves.\"",

These heads precisely reflect the demographic makeup of Mecklenburg County, and are individually controlled by 1600 discrete motors.\n\nAt the start of a workweek the heads are gathered into a porous cloud. Gradually, gracefully, they move one by one to create an epic three-dimensional face. This likeness then slowly reverts back into a cloud.\n\nThe following week a different portrait builds and dissolves. In a cycle of assembly and dispersion, new faces are continually formed over time.\n\nFor example, one sequence portrays an elderly Latina. Reaching an optical crescendo on Wednesday afternoon, her face gradually disappears by Friday evening.\n\nSubsequent weeks witness the formation of a 25-year-old African-American man, an Asian boy, a middle-aged Caucasian woman, and so on. Persistence of Vision is not “of” anyone in particular; it is “of everyone”.\n\nAn allegory for the justice system on both the macrocosmic and microcosmic levels, the sculpture reflects the organic process of the law and the society it serves.\"",

The first church building was located on West Trade Street a few blocks from the square. The church purchased its current site on 7th and Tryon Street in 1858 and constructed a small wooden Gothic church. This building was replaced with the existing church in 1892, which was expanded in 1911 and 1998.<br> St.Peter's has a tradition of being a center of activity in Charlotte. In 1865, Jefferson Davis and his retreating confederate cabinet worshipped at St.Peter's following the assassination of President Lincoln, that day the church's rector preached a sermon on the great tragedy of the death of the president.<br> St.Peter's also has a long history of ministering to Charlotte. In 1878,The church founded St. Peter's Hospital. The church surrendered the hospital charter in 1938 and provided financial support and 30 acres of property on Morehead and Kings Drive and worked with the city of Charlotte to establish what today is know as Carolina's Medical Center.

The first church building was located on West Trade Street a few blocks from the square. The church purchased its current site on 7th and Tryon Street in 1858 and constructed a small wooden Gothic church. This building was replaced with the existing church in 1892, which was expanded in 1911 and 1998.<br> St.Peter's has a tradition of being a center of activity in Charlotte. In 1865, Jefferson Davis and his retreating confederate cabinet worshipped at St.Peter's following the assassination of President Lincoln, that day the church's rector preached a sermon on the great tragedy of the death of the president.<br> St.Peter's also has a long history of ministering to Charlotte.
